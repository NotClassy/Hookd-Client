##Hookd

Hookd is a web app for transforming React Class Components to Functional components utlizing Hooks.

Simply copy your React Class component into the Code field and hit the "transform" button. 
Our algorithm will parse through your file, find relevant use cases for useState, useContext, and useEffect. 

Our program will modify the Abstract Syntax Tree accordingly, and generate a transformed component for you to copy out and utilize at your convenience!
